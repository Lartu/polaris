# About Polaris
**Polaris** is a stack-based, interpreted programming language with strings as its only data type.
It has been designed to be **small** in size and **minimal** in language features. **Polaris** was
conceived to run under **Unix** systems, either as a script running system or in REPL mode.
It has been written in C++98, so it can probably be compiled with any C++ compiler out there.


**To be completed!**
