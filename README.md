# About Polaris
**Polaris** is a stack-based, concatenative, interpreted programming language with strings as its only data type.
It has been designed to be **small** in size and **minimal** in language features. **Polaris** was
conceived to run under **Unix** systems.
It has been written in C++98, so it can probably be compiled with any C++ compiler out there.

# Building Polaris
To build Polaris, clone this repository and run `make`. You can install it using `make install`.

# Documentation
